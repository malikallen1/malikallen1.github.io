                <p class="gray">In 1978, the Laserdisc was first made available on the market in Atlanta, Georgia. The Laserdisc was an optical disc format that was used to store images and sound on the surface of the disc. A standard Laserdisc is about 12 inches in diameter and is made from two single-sided aluminum discs that are layered in plastic. Early Laserdiscs used analog video that's stored in the composite domain with analog FM stereo sound and PCM digital audio.</p>
                <p class="dark-gray">Earlier Laserdisc players used gas helium-neon laser tubes to read discs and had a red-orange light with a wavelength of 632.8 nanometers. Later solid-state players used infrared semiconductor laser diodes with a wavelength of 780 nanometers. Pioneer Corporation purchased the majority stake in the format in 1980. The format was very popular in Japan, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. It didn't take off due to the rising popularity of VHS and Betamax. DVDs ended up replacing the format in the North American retail marketplace.</p>
