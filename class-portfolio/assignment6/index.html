                    <p>In 1995, JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich. In 1996, Netscape 2 was released with JavaScript 1.0. JavaScript eventually became an ECMA standard in 1997. ECMAScript 1 was released later that same year. Internet Explorer became the first browser to support ECMAScript 1 in 1997.</p>

                    <p>In 1998, ECMAScript 2 was released and Netscape 42 was released with JavaScript 1.3. In 1999, Internet Explorer 5 became the first browser to support ECMAScript 2. Later that same year, ECMAScript 3 was released. In 2000, Firefox 1 was released with JavaScript 1.5. JavaScript eventually became supported with all modern browsers.</p>

                    <p>JavaScript is not related to the Java programming language. Those two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use. The core language for JavaScript, ECMAScript, can be defined as a language syntax, an error handling mechanism, type, a prototype-based inheritance mechanism, a built-in object, a strict mode, a module system, or a basic memory model. </p>

                <section id="SectionFour">
                    <p>JavaScript can be used for a lot of impressive things. According to Mozilla, the core client-side JavaScript can store useful values inside variables. JavaScript can also let you create operations on strings of text. It can even run code in response to certain events that happen on a website. Application Programming Interfaces can be used alongside JavaScript.</p>

                <section id="SectionFive">
                    <p>According of Mozilla, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) can be used to implement programs that are normally viewed as impossible to implement. There are two types of APIs that are programmed with JavaScript. Those two types of APIs are Browser APIs and third party APIs. JavaScript is easy to implement in any programming software. JavaScript can be used to upgrade a webpage's design.</p>

                    <p>In conclusion, JavaScript is used by a lot of web designers for very impressive things. People can use JavaScript to improve their website's presentation. These improvements can be viewed on all modern web browsers. JavaScript can be used in tandem with HTML and CSS.
