                    <p>When I asked my mother when she first discovered computers and how she learned to use them, she responded by stating that she first discovered them when she was in elementary school in the early 1980s. She also mentioned that she purchased her first computer in 1992 and would use it to make posters to hang on her bedroom walls. She said that she bought an AOL free trial disc from Walgreens. The free trial discs allowed users to connect to the world wide web using dial-up. When I asked my mother how computers played a huge role in her life, she responded stating that she used computers while attending college at the DeVry Institute of Technology. She said that she worked for Ameritech, which is now known as AT&T, where she spent 8 hours a day working with computers. Her current position at Blue Cross Blue Shield Illinois also involved an 8-hour shift involving computers. Blue Cross Blue Shield Illinois also provided her with a laptop so she could do her remote work on it. She also mentions that she spends her free time surfing the internet and reading social media posts on her computer. When I asked my mother how she believed computers shaped the lives of others, she responded stating that they are shaping everyone’s lives by making everything available without leaving their homes. She mentioned that you could do research on a computer instead of having to go to the library. She mentioned that people could socialize with friends and family via email instead of mailing letters. She mentioned that people could shop without having to leave their house. She states that the recent pandemic had led to more people using computers for various tasks.</p>
                    <p>When I asked my aunt when she first discovered computers and how she learned to use them, she responded by stating that she first discovered computers in the 1980s while in high school where they were offering a computer programming class to the students. She goes into further detail by mentioning that she was quite fascinated with learning about what computers could be used for and how to operate them. She mentioned that she learned how to create basic programs in the class. She described the experience as “a little difficult, but fun at the same time”. When I asked my aunt how computers played a huge role in her life, she responded by stating that they play a major role in her life because she uses them daily. She mentions that she does not think that she could function at her workplace or at home without a computer. She expands on that thought further by mentioning that computers make everyday tasks easier, efficient, and faster in her daily routine. She also mentions that without computers helping people, all tasks that are performed daily would be more difficult to complete. When I asked my aunt how she believed computers shaped the lives of others, she answered by stating that she truly believed that computers have brought people closer together. She states that it facilitates contacts between people by using email, chatting, video conferencing, and social medias. She expands on that thought by stating that they definitely help to save time and make life much easier for people. She mentions you could now do research on computers instead of having to go to a library. She also mentions that you could socialize with friends and family via email, as well as shopping for groceries, household items, clothing and electronics on computers without having to leave your house.</p>
                    <p>When I asked my cousin when she first discovered computers and how she learned to use them, she answered by stating that she saw a first-generation Microsoft Gateway computer that belonged to my mother. She mentioned that she learned how to use a computer at the age of five (or six) and would receive adult supervision periodically to ensure that she was working the device properly. She also mentioned that she saw my aunt using a Microsoft desktop computer at her childhood apartment. When I asked my cousin how computers played a huge role in her life, she responded by mentioning that my aunt helped her type out her first book report in the second grade. She mentioned that she started to rely on computers much more around the mid 2000s, when she started to use social media websites like Tagged and Myspace. She also mentioned that she would download music that she found online so she could put them on an MP3 player. She states that she would use the downloaded songs from the computer to make CDs of her favorite music artist. When I asked my cousin how she believed computers shaped the lives of others, she responded by stating that computers have made an impact on us “ironically”. She states that everyone needs the convenience of a computer or a laptop. She mentioned that society has advertised computers in a way where it is a necessity in a home. She also mentioned that the pandemic has caused more people to rely on computers. She states that people relied on computers to work from home for two years and connect with family. She also states that people need laptops in order to check their email daily for work or leisure.</p>
