                    <h1>Welcome to the Secret Page</h1>
                    <p>Congratulations, you found the secret page. I've first discovered computers when I used my mother's computer at a very young age. Ever since then, I've used computers for both work and entertainment. In my personal opinion, I believe that computers have impacted many people's lives because they are considered essential items. Ever since the pandemic, more and more people started to use computers for various tasks. People need computers in order to do many important activities like doing remote work and go shopping. People also use computers to gain knowledge on topics that they may find interesting.</p>
                    <p>There are many technology advancement that I expect to see in a decade from now. In my opinion, I expect to see more computers with lightning fast speed. The faster speed could help people finish their tasks quicker. I also expect there to be more accessibility options in computers. If there are more accessibility options, then more people with disabilities will be able to use computers.</p>
