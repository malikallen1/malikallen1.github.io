        On one hand, I believe that the current state of the internet could have a positive impact in todayâ€™s society and businesses. There are numerous charity organizations that have online presences. Charities like UNICEF and American Red Cross have a massive online presence. When charities get an online presence, people are more likely to donate to them. People like to help others when it comes to emergencies. There are also websites that falls under the same category like GoFundMe that could help people in need. A lot of businesses could benefit from having an online presence. When the internet first hit the mainstream in the late 1990s, a lot of brands jumped in on the bandwagon.
        Some brands that gained an online presence during this time include IBM, Microsoft, Apple, Warner Bros., Disney, and Walmart. There are even a lot of companies that got their start on the internet that have also benefitted from having an online presence. These companies include Amazon, Google, Yahoo, Craigslist, Facebook, and eBay. Most internet-based companies have been met with great success. If someone is planning on opening up a business, it is essential that said business should have an online presence. If the business has an online presence, then it is more likely to succeed. People are more likely to support a business if it has an online presence.
        On the other hand, I believe that large corporations have unfair advantages against smaller web authors. Their larger presence could be considered unfair to smaller webpages. The dominance of Google and Facebook has made it extremely difficult for smaller pages to compete with them. I believe that smaller webpages should have a fair advantage in order to compete with larger webpages. Independent web authors should get an equal amount of attention as larger web authors. I believe that independent web authors deserve more recognition and respect. If they have more recognition and respect, that means that they would be more likely to be treated equally with larger web authors.
